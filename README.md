Comment Toxicity Classification Project

Overview:
This project involves using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for classifying comment toxicity. The main goal is to identify and categorize harmful or inappropriate content in comments, thereby improving moderation and enhancing online safety.

Key Features:
Text Classification: Implemented BERT to classify comments into various toxicity categories.
Fine-Tuning: Adapted a pre-trained BERT model specifically for toxicity detection by training it on a tailored dataset.
Performance Evaluation: Assessed the model’s accuracy and effectiveness in identifying toxic comments, and made optimizations to improve performance.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Machine Learning Framework: PyTorch
Model: BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
Visualization Tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Implementation Details:
Data Preprocessing:
Cleaning: I cleaned the text data to remove any noise or irrelevant information. This involved standard text preprocessing techniques such as removing special characters and normalizing text.
Tokenization: Used BERT’s tokenizer to split comments into tokens and convert these tokens into numerical representations. This transformation is essential for preparing text data for model input.
Numerical Conversion: Converted the tokenized comments into numerical IDs, ensuring that all inputs are in a format suitable for the BERT model.

Model Training:
Fine-Tuning BERT: Fine-tuned a pre-trained BERT model on the toxicity dataset. This involved adjusting the model’s parameters to better fit the specific task of classifying comment toxicity.
Training Process: Implemented the training process using PyTorch, including defining the loss function, optimizer, and training loop. During training, the model learned to differentiate between different levels of toxicity based on the provided labeled data.

Evaluation:
Performance Metrics: Evaluated the model’s performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. This helped in understanding how well the model performs in detecting and categorizing toxic content.
Optimization: Based on the evaluation results, I fine-tuned hyperparameters and adjusted the model to improve classification accuracy. This iterative process was crucial for enhancing the model’s performance and ensuring its reliability.

Creating DataLoaders:
Balanced Dataset: Created DataLoaders for the training, test, and validation datasets. This involved batching the data and shuffling it where necessary to ensure a balanced and effective training process.
Debugging: Addressed and resolved issues related to data mismatches and ensured that all tensors (inputs, attention masks, and labels) had consistent dimensions for seamless processing.

Visualization:
Performance Visualization: Used Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visualizations such as performance curves, confusion matrices, and other metrics to interpret the model’s effectiveness and insights into its performance.
Through these steps, I successfully developed a comment toxicity classification system using BERT, which can effectively identify and categorize harmful comments, contributing to better online moderation and safety.
