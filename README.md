Comment Toxicity Classification Project

Overview
This project aims to classify comment toxicity using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) implemented in PyTorch. The goal is to detect and categorize harmful content in comments to enhance moderation and safety in online platforms.

Key Features
Text Classification: Utilizes BERT to classify comments into various toxicity categories.
Fine-Tuning: Adapts pre-trained BERT models for specific toxicity detection tasks.
Performance Evaluation: Assesses model accuracy and effectiveness in identifying harmful content.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Machine Learning Framework: PyTorch
Model: BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

How It Works

Data Preprocessing:
Clean and preprocess text data to prepare it for model training.
Tokenize comments and convert them into numerical representations using BERT.

Model Training:
Fine-tune the pre-trained BERT model on the comment toxicity dataset.
Train the model to classify comments into different toxicity levels.

Evaluation:
Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Optimize the model to improve classification results.
